## Abstract:

Brain extracellular matrix (ECM) structure mediates many aspects of neuronal function.Probing changes in ECM structure could provide insights into aging and neurologicaldisease. Herein, we demonstrate the ability to characterize changes in brain ECMstructure using multiple particle tracking (MPT). MPT was carried out in organotypic ratbrain slices to detect induced and naturally occurring changes in ECM structure.Induced degradation of neural ECM led to a significant increase in nanoparticlediffusive ability in the brain extracellular space. For structural changes that occurnaturally during development, an inverse relationship existed between age andnanoparticle diffusion. Using the age-dependent dataset, we applied extreme gradientboosting (XGBoost) to generate models capable of classifying nanoparticle trajectories.Collectively, this work demonstrates the utility of MPT combined with machine learningfor measuring changes in brain ECM structure and predicting associated complexfeatures such as developmental age.
